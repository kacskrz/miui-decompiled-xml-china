    <string name="AllowedDomainsForAppsDesc">"Enables Google Chrome's restricted log in feature in G Suite and prevents users from changing this setting. If you define this setting, the user will only be able to access Google Apps using accounts from the specified domains (note that this does not work for gmail.com/googlemail.com). This setting will NOT prevent the user from loging in on a managed device that requires Google authentication. The user will still be allowed to sign in to accounts from other domains, but they will receive an error when trying to use G Suite with those accounts. If you leave this setting empty/not-configured, the user will be able to access G Suite with any account.

    <string name="CertificateTransparencyEnforcementDisabledForCasDesc">"Disables enforcing Certificate Transparency requirements for a list of subjectPublicKeyInfo hashes. This policy allows disabling Certificate Transparency disclosure requirements for certificate chains that contain certificates with one of the specified subjectPublicKeyInfo hashes. This allows certificates that would otherwise be untrusted, because they were not properly publicly disclosed, to continue to be used for Enterprise hosts. In order for Certificate Transparency enforcement to be disabled when this policy is set, one of the following conditions must be met: 1. The hash is of the server certificate's subjectPublicKeyInfo. 2. The hash is of a subjectPublicKeyInfo that appears in a CA certificate in the certificate chain, that CA certificate is constrained via the X.509v3 nameConstraints extension, one or more directoryName nameConstraints are present in the permittedSubtrees, and the directoryName contains an organizationName attribute. 3. The hash is of a subjectPublicKeyInfo that appears in a CA certificate in the certificate chain, the CA certificate has one or more organizationName attributes in the certificate Subject, and the server's certificate contains the same number of organizationName attributes, in the same order, and with byte-for-byte identical values. A subjectPublicKeyInfo hash is specified by concatenating the hash algorithm name, the \\/\\ character, and the Base64 encoding of that hash algorithm applied to the DER-encoded subjectPublicKeyInfo of the specified certificate. This Base64 encoding is the same format as an SPKI Fingerprint, as defined in RFC 7469, Section 2.4. Unrecognized hash algorithms are ignored. The only supported hash algorithm at this time is \\sha256\\. If this policy is not set, any certificate that is required to be disclosed via Certificate Transparency will be treated as untrusted if it is not disclosed according to the Certificate Transparency policy."</string>

    <string name="CertificateTransparencyEnforcementDisabledForLegacyCasDesc">Disables enforcing Certificate Transparency requirements for a list of Legacy Certificate Authorities. This policy allows disabling Certificate Transparency disclosure requirements for certificate chains that contain certificates with one of the specified subjectPublicKeyInfo hashes. This allows certificates that would otherwise be untrusted, because they were not properly publicly disclosed, to continue to be used for Enterprise hosts. In order for Certificate Transparency enforcement to be disabled when this policy is set, the hash must be of a subjectPublicKeyInfo appearing in a CA certificate that is recognized as a Legacy Certificate Authority (CA). A Legacy CA is a CA that has been publicly trusted by default one or more operating systems supported by Google Chrome, but is not trusted by the Android Open Source Project or Google Chrome OS. A subjectPublicKeyInfo hash is specified by concatenating the hash algorithm name, the \\/\\ character, and the Base64 encoding of that hash algorithm applied to the DER-encoded subjectPublicKeyInfo of the specified certificate. This Base64 encoding is the same format as an SPKI Fingerprint, as defined in RFC 7469, Section 2.4. Unrecognized hash algorithms are ignored.

    <string name="CertificateTransparencyEnforcementDisabledForUrlsDesc">Disables enforcing Certificate Transparency requirements to the listed URLs. This policy allows certificates for the hostnames in the specified URLs to not be disclosed via Certificate Transparency. This allows certificates that would otherwise be untrusted, because they were not properly publicly disclosed, to continue to be used, but makes it harder to detect misissued certificates for those hosts. A URL pattern is formatted according to https://www.chromium.org/administrators/url-blacklist-filter-format. However, because certificates are valid for a given hostname independent of the scheme, port, or path, only the hostname portion of the URL is considered. Wildcard hosts are not supported.

    <string name="OverrideSecurityRestrictionsOnInsecureOriginDesc">"The policy specifies a list of origins (URLs) or hostname patterns (such as \\*.example.com\\) to be treated as secure contexts. The intent is to allow organizations to set up a staging server for internal web development, so that their developers can test out features requiring secure contexts without having to deploy TLS on the staging server. Setting a list of URLs in this policy has the same effect as setting the command-line flag '--unsafely-treat-insecure-origin-as-secure' to a comma-separated list of the same URLs. If the policy is set, it will override the command-line flag. For more information on secure contexts, see https://www.w3.org/TR/secure-contexts/"</string>

If you choose fixed server proxy mode, you can specify further options in 'Address or URL of proxy server' and 'Comma-separated list of proxy bypass rules'. Only the HTTP proxy server with the highest priority is available for ARC-apps. If you choose to use a .pac proxy script, you must specify the URL to the script in 'URL to a proxy .pac file'. For detailed examples, visit: https://www.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/network-settings#TOC-Command-line-options-for-proxy-sett.

This setting, SitePerProcessAndroid, isolates all sites. If the policy is enabled, each site will run in its own process. If the policy is disabled, no explicit Site Isolation will happen and field trials of IsolateOriginsAndroid and SitePerProcessAndroid will be disabled. Users will still be able to enable SitePerProcess manually. If the policy is not configured, the user will be able to change this setting. NOTE: On Android, Site Isolation is experimental. Support will improve over time, but currently it may cause performance problems. NOTE: This policy applies only to Chrome on Android running on devices with strictly more than 1GB of RAM.

These policies are limited to 1000 entries; subsequent entries will be ignored. Note that it is not recommended to block internal 'chrome://*' URLs since this may lead to unexpected errors. If this policy is not set no URL will be blacklisted in the browser."</string>

    <string name="URLWhitelistDesc">"Allows access to the listed URLs, as exceptions to the URL blacklist. See the description of the URL blacklist policy for the format of entries of this list. This policy can be used to open exceptions to restrictive blacklists. For example, '*' can be blacklisted to block all requests, and this policy can be used to allow access to a limited list of URLs. It can be used to open exceptions to certain schemes, subdomains of other domains, ports, or specific paths. The most specific filter will determine if a URL is blocked or allowed. The whitelist takes precedence over the blacklist. This policy is limited to 1000 entries; subsequent entries will be ignored.
